# Wave-Generator-and-Modulation

ENGG 453 Lab 4

Wave Generator: Able to output three different waveforms; square, saw-tooth, and triangle.
                Able to adjust frequency and amplitude of waveforms.

Wave Modulation: Frequency & amplitude modulation using a distance sensor with Voltmeter. 
                 Modulation will change pitch and loudness of a connected buzzer.
